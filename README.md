From the NYC Citibike Analysis story above, it can be shown through the panels, the average makeup of city-bike users by their gender and their usertype (Subscription). In the following panels, the triip duration for these riders can be shown along with the peak hours/days of bike rentals. From this data we are able to identify who is most likely to subscribe, their average ride duration and when peak/off-peak hours are.


## Summary

From the off-peak and peak hours data, we are able to identify when the ideal time would be for to have maximum bikes out for rental and when the best time would be for bike maintance. We are also able to see who our target audience is while identifying where citi-bike is potentially weaker in. Therefore, we can craft marketing strategies towards our current target audience and our weaker target signals to attract more subscribers.
